        - [ ] Similar to PureData but textual (not graphical)
        - [ ] Specify Antlr4 grammar
            - [ ] Everything has inputs and outputs. They might be empty though but must be specified.
                - [ ] Outputs of one box can be connected to inputs of another box
                - [ ] Between every connected output of box A and input of box B is a function.
                      Could be the identity function in the simplest case.
                - [ ] This connecting function maps input type of box A to output type of box B
                - [ ] Connecting functions will be type-checked
        - [ ] Will include predefined building blocks which are just connecting functions or boxes, e.g. euclidean rhythms, sequencers, midi outputs, ...
        - [ ] Values must be generated at every beat.
        - [ ] Language Server Protocol implementation
            - [ ] Supports selection of functions, boxes, etc...
        - [ ] Can be read on-the-fly for live performances
